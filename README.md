# CV-Crowd-Management

This project aims to develop a computer vision-based system to minimize congestion in metro stations. By analyzing live video feeds, the system uses the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model to detect and count individuals, estimate crowd density, and provide real-time alerts when overcrowding occurs. Using deep learning techniques for accurate monitoring.
